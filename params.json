Only supports the ip, protocol and connection name.\r\n  - Supports only one database at a time.\r\n\r\n## Download ##\r\n  - Alpha5 : http://bit.ly/ssh-telnet-launcher-alpha5\r\n\r\n## How to install ##\r\n  - Extract the content of the archive using 'tar -xzf ssh-telnet-launcher-xxx.tar.gz'\r\n  - Go into the extracted directory : 'cd ssh-telnet-launcher-xxx'\r\n  - Execute the install script : 'sudo ./install.sh --install' or 'sudo sh install.sh --install' contained in the directory\r\n  - It will install this program in /usr/local/lib/sshtelnetlauncher/\r\n\r\n## How to configure ##\r\n  - Edit the configuration file contained in : /usr/local/lib/sshtelnetlauncher/sshtellaunch.conf\r\n  - For database_path put the relative or absolute path to the PuttyCM database you want to use\r\n  \t- Relative paths start from /usr/local/lib/sshtelnetlauncher\r\n  - Then for ssh_path put the ssh command path (usually /usr/bin/ssh). To find it use 'whereis ssh'.\r\n  - Then for telnet_path put the telnet command path (usually /usr/bin/telnet). To find it use 'whereis telnet'.\r\n  \t- It may not be installed on your system. Just install it and it will work fine 'sudo apt-get install telnet'\r\n\r\n## How to start the program ##\r\n  - Simply execute /usr/local/lib/sshtelnetlauncher/SSHTelnetLauncher or install the Unity launcher (see below)\r\n  - If this fails do 'chmod +x /usr/local/lib/sshtelnetlauncher/SSHTelnetLauncher'\r\n\r\n## How to upgrade ##\r\n*Coming soon*\r\n  - For now :\r\n    - Go into /usr/local/lib/sshtelnetlauncher\r\n  \t- backup your config somewhere (sshtellauncher.conf)\r\n  \t- ./install.sh --uninstall\r\n  \t- Redo the installation\r\n  \t- Copy your backed up configuration back into /usr/local/lib/sshtelnetlauncher\r\n\r\n## How to uninstall ##\r\n  - Go into /usr/local/lib/sshtelnetlauncher : 'cd /usr/local/lib/sshtelnetlauncher'\r\n  - Execute 'sudo ./install.sh --uninstall'\r\n    - This will uninstall everything (except for the xterm configuration if you installed it)\r\n    - To delete the xterm configuration 'rm ~/.Xresources'\r\n\r\n## Unity Launcher ##\r\n  - A unity launcher (for Ubuntu 11+) is provided in the folder\r\n  \t- Go in the folder you installed from or in /usr/local/lib/sshtelnetlauncher\r\n  \t- Execute './install.sh --unity-launcher'\r\n  \t- Input the user for which you wish the launcher to be installed\r\n  \t  - This has to be the user's folder name under /home\r\n  \t- It will then appear in your dash\r\n\r\n## xterm customization (highly recommended) ##\r\n  - If your xterm is not configured to use different fonts, size, color, etc. We suggest you use our configuration file for a better experience.\r\n  - Execute './install.sh --xterm-conf'\r\n  - Input the user for which you wish the configuration to be installed\r\n \t- This has to be the user's folder name under /home\r\n  - After you can do : 'xrdb -load <user>/.Xresources' or restart your x session to apply changes to xterm.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
